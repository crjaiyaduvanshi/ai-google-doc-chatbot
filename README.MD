# AI Chatbot for Google Docs (RAG System)

This project is a fully functional **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that reads content from a **public Google Doc** and answers user questions strictly based on the document’s content. The chatbot supports semantic search, multi-turn conversations, and inline citations, simulating real-world enterprise knowledge-base assistants.
